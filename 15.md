### Logical Operators

We can use logical operators to make our conditionals a little more complex.

There are 3 types of logical operators,

---

`&&` returns true only if both comparisons are true.

( comparison1 && comparison2 )

---

`||` returns true if either one of the comparison is true.

( comparison1 || comparison2 )

---

`!` reverses the value of a boolean expression.
