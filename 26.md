Looping Arrays、Updating Arrays

### Arrays

Sometimes values can be closely related and creating one variable after another can be very messy such as below.

```java
double price1 = 5.99;
double price2 = 6.99;
double price3 = 7.99;
double price4 = 8.99;
double price5 = 9.99;
```

So what we can do is to store all of these values at the same time in an organized way which is called an array.

```java
double[] prices = { 5.99, 6.99, 7.99, 8.99, 9.99 };
```

Although an array can hold many values, all of them have to share the same type. 

For example as below, `integers` **points to** an array of integer values.

```java
int[] integers = { 1, 2, 3 };
```

### Talk is cheap

```java
String[] kindoms = { "qwe", "asd", "zxc" };
```

The truth is:

the variable `kingdoms` doesn't store the array directly

instead

it stores a [reference] that points to it

```java
// You can try to compile and run this line of code,
// you will get a hashcode representation of the reference.
System.out.println(kingdoms);
```

and each element is stored at an index

what will happen if I try to access an element outside the range of the array ?

```java
System.out.println(kingdoms[3]);
```

Java throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, in essence, crashing our application, telling us that we have an error in our code —— "Index 3 is out of bounds"
