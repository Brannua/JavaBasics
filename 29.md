### The reference trap

```java
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] numbers2 = numbers;
```

Do not set array variables equal to each other!

Instead, create a new array, then, copy every value using a for loop.

### A better solution

Arrays.copyOf(a, b);

`a` means that the array you want to copy.

`b` means that how much of it you want to copy.
