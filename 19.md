### Parameters

Functions with parameters expect to receive values.(these functions rely on parameters to perform their task)

Functions【without】parameters【do not expect】to receive values.

Parameters are essentially just variables.

### Arguments

A value that you pass into a function is known as an argument.

**Parameters and Arguments makes functions completely reusable**!

### Notice

When a function defines parameters, then in order to call it,

you need to pass in a matching number of arguments based on the position of these parameters.
