## Scope

> The scope of a variable determines its life span.

The take home message is:
    You can never access a variable outside the scope that it was defined in.

## Global Scope

Please against using global variables,

instead, you should keep everything local and use parameters,

because when you have too many global variables, you start losing track of what's really going on(such as from your debugger in vscode).
