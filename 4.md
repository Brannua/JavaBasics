### char type

We can use the `char` type to store a single character.

note: char is short for a character.

```java
char gender = 'F';
```

We can join a String value with a char value using the `+` symbol.

```java
System.out.println(
    "Gender: " + 'F'
);
```

```java
String gender = "F"; // Obviously, String is more flexible than char.

// So why not always use String ?
// And what's the point of a char variable if it can only store one character ?
```

The answer is【memory】and【performance】!

char consumes less memory, and char is faster than String !
