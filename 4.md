### Type: String

We can use the `String` type to store text.

```java
String sentence = "Hello world !";
```

If you want to update String varibles, just let the variable equals to a new value.

```java
sentence = "Good morning !";
```

String unlike int in memory, 

no matter what you store in the integer variable, it's always 4 bytes,

but with String, empty text alone takes up 24 bytes,

and the more text that you add to a string, the more memory it takes up.

---

You can use the `+` operator to join two String values.

```java
String sentence = "His name is: ";
String placeholder = "Harry";
System.out.println(sentence + placeholder);
```

You can use the `+` operator to join String and int values.

```java
int points = 50;
String announcement = " points for Gryffindor";
System.out.println(points + announcement);
```
