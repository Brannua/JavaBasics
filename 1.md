## To run Java code, you need

1. Java Compiler - to compile your code.

2. Java Runtime - to run the compiled code.

    So, this is why JDK provides a compiler、a runTime、and a lot of other things.

## Roadmap

1. Install a JDK(Java Development Kit) => from Amazon Corretto

    Amazon Corretto is just a distribution which once installed, does the work of

    setting up a JDK in your computer.

    Basically all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

    [Amazon-Corretto-11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)


    ```shell
    # Checking for a JDK

    javac -version # mine: 11.0.18, teacher's: 11.0.10
    java -version
    ```

    Finished ! you've just installed a JDK, now your computer can compile and run Java code.

2. Download a text editor

3. Write and run our first code
