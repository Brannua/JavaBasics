## To run Java code, you need

1. A Java Compiler - to compile your code.

2. A Java Runtime - to run the compiled code.

	So, this is why JDK provides a Compiler、a Runtime、and a lot of other things.

## Roadmap

1. Install a JDK(Java Development Kit) on your machine => from Amazon Corretto

	Amazon Corretto is just a distribution which once installed, does the work of setting up a JDK on your machine.
	Basically all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

	```shell
	javac -version  # check compiler
	java -version   # check runtime
	```

	Finished ! you've just installed a JDK, now your computer can compile and run Java code.

2. Download a text editor to write code

	I use vim & vscode(the extension pack for java is must).

	Now you have everything you need to start building Java applications!

3. Write & Run your first Java code

	```shell
	# Every java file needs to follow the naming convention -> CamelCase
	touch HelloJava.java
	```
	```java
	// In java, you must write all of your code in a class.
	// And the ClassName needs to be the same as your FileName.
	// So here we create a class.
	public class HelloJava {
	}
	
	/* Notice:
		the [public] exposes current class to other classes that may exist inside your workspace,
		but since now we have only one class,
		so it's optional.
	*/
	```
	
	All right, so what's next is the `main()` method, which is the entry point of a Java application.
	
	And inside main, we're going to print the message "Hello Java"
	
	```java
	public class HelloJava {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println("Hello Java");
		}
	}
	
	/* Notice:
		the semicolon is really important, which means end of statement.
		every statement in Java, every line of code, needs a semicolon at the end.
		so if you forget your semicolon, your code is not gonna run.
	*/
	```
	
	Now we're ready to compile and run our Java code.
	
	```shell
	# The javac command compiles your javaCode into byteCode
	javac <FileName>.java
	
	# The java command executes the compiled code
	java <FileName>
	```
	
	For example
