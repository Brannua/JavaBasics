## To run Java code, you need

1. Java Compiler - to compile your code.

2. Java Runtime - to run the compiled code.

    So, this is why JDK provides a compiler、a runTime、and a lot of other things.

## Roadmap

1. Install a JDK(Java Development Kit) => from Amazon Corretto

    Amazon Corretto is just a distribution which once installed, does the work of setting up a JDK in your computer. Basically all you need to do is install it and it's going to do the heavy lifting.

    [Amazon-Corretto-11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)


    ```shell
    # Checking for a JDK
    javac -version # mine: 11.0.18, teacher's: 11.0.10
    java -version
    ```

    Finished ! you've just installed a JDK, now your computer can compile and run Java code.

2. Download a text editor

    You need a text editor to write code.

    On windows, I choose [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

    then download [Extension Pack for Java] in vscode.

    Now you have everything you need to start building Java applications!

3. Write & Run your first Java code

    ```bash
    # Create a java project.
    cd ~
    mkdir section-one
    cd section-one

    # Every java file needs to follow the naming convention -> CamelCase.
    touch HelloJava.java
    ```

    ```java
    // In java, you must write all of your code in a class.
    // And the ClassName needs to be the same as your FileName.
    // So here we create a class.
    public class HelloJava {

    }

    /* Notice:
        the [public] exposes current class to other classes,
        but since now we have only one class, so it's not really doing anything.
    */
    ```

    All right, so what's next is the `main()` method, which is the entry point of a Java application.

    And inside main, we're going to print the message "Hello Java !"

    ```java
    public class HelloJava {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello Java !");
        }
    }

    /* Notice:
        the semicolon is really important, which means end of statement.
        every statement in Java, every line of code, needs a semicolon at the end.
        if you forget your semicolon, your code is not gonna run.
    */
    ```

    Now we're ready to compile and run our Java code.

    ```bash
    # The javac command compiles your code
    javac <FileName>.java

    # The java command runs the compiled code
    java <FileName>
    ```

> Good luck on Workbook 1.1 !
