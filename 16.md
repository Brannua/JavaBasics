## Switch Statements

whenever you're comparing one variable against a long list of values, such as

```java
if (weather.equals("sunny")) {
    // code
} else if (weather.equals("cloudy")) {
    // code
} else if (weather.equals("rainy")) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}
```

you should avoid having a long list of `else if` statements, because this looks so disgusting !

Instead, you should favor using a switch statement which was designed to compare one variable against a list of cases.

```java
switch (weather) {
    case "sunny":   // code     break;
    case "cloudy":  // code     break;
    case "rainy":   // code     break;
    default:        // code
}
```

Then you might be asking that when to use `if` vs `switch` ?

---

The only thing you can really do with `switch` is compare one variable against a list of values.

---

`if` statement is more flexible so that suitable for complex conditions, such as when you need to compare multiple variables, they give you the flexibility to evaluate compound conditions using logical operators.

```java
if (temperature >= 80 && humidity >= 60) {
    System.out.println("It's too hot and humid\n");
} else {
    System.out.println("It's comfortable\n");
}
```
