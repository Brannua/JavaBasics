As you write more and more code inside `main()`, you'll notice that it becomes increasingly cluttered and messy.

And the more code you write, the more unreadable that it becomes.

### Functions

A function is a reusable grouping of code that performs a task.

Some functions rely on parameters to perform their task.

Some functions will return a final value.

Instead of writing all of your code inside of a single code block,

you can split it up into functions and call them as needed.

Organize your code using functions!
