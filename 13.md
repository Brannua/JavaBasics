## Comparison Operators

`>`, Greater than, returns `true` if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.

`<`, Less than, returns `true` if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.

`>=`, Greater than or equal to, returns `true` if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.

`<=`, Less than or equal to, returns `true` if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right.

`==`, returns `true` if two values are equal.

`!=`, returns `true` if two values are not equal.

### Comparing Strings

Do not use `==` or `!=` to compare strings.

Instead, you can compare one string to another by calling `equals()` from one of them.

```java
String str1 = "hello";
String str2 = "hello";

str1.equals(str2);  // true
!str1.equals(str2); // false
```
