## Scanner

Scanner contains many methods that we can use to scan for user input.

| method       | scans for |
| ------------ | --------- |
| nextInt()    | integers  |
| nextDouble() | decimals  |
| nextLine()   | text      |
| ...          | ...       |

### Usage

We can create an instance of Scanner that can receive input from the System.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

Now, we can use sc's methods to pick up integers„ÄÅdecimals or text from user input.

```java
int coffeeAmount    = sc.nextInt();
double coffeePrice  = sc.nextDouble();
String name         = sc.nextLine();
```

Once you are done with sc, always close it, otherwise you're going to get a resource leak.

```java
sc.close();
```
