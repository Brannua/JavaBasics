## Scanner

Scanner contains many methods that we can use to scan for user input.

| method       | scan for  | explaination                                       |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| nextInt()    | integers  | skips the whiteSpace and picks up the next Integer |
| nextLong()   | integers  | skips the whiteSpace and picks up the next Long    |
| nextDouble() | decimals  | skips the whiteSpace and picks up the next Double  |
| next()       | text      | skips the whiteSpace and picks up the next String  |
| nextLine()   | text      | picks up a line of data                            |
| ...          | ...       | ...                                                |

> The default delimiter is white space.

### Usage

1、Create an instance of Scanner which can receive input from the `System.in`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

2、Use Scanner's methods to pick up (integers、decimals、text、...) from user input.

```java
int coffeeAmount    = sc.nextInt();
double coffeePrice  = sc.nextDouble();
String name         = sc.nextLine();
...
```

3、Once you are done with Scanner, always close it, otherwise you're going to get a resource leak.

```java
sc.close();
```
