## Scanner

Scanner contains methods that we can use to receive user input.

| method       | scans for |
| ------------ | --------- |
| nextInt()    | integers  |
| nextDouble() | decimals  |
| nextLine()   | text      |

We can create an instance of Scanner that can receive input from the System.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

// pick up user input
String name = sc.nextLine();
```
