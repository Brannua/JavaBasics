## Scanner

Scanner contains many methods that we can use to scan for user input.

| method       | scans for |
| ------------ | --------- |
| nextInt()    | integers  |
| nextDouble() | decimals  |
| nextLine()   | text      |
| ...          | ...       |

### Usage

1、Create an instance of Scanner which can receive input from the `System.in`.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

2、Use Scanner's methods to pick up (integers、decimals、text、...) from user input.

```java
int coffeeAmount    = sc.nextInt();
double coffeePrice  = sc.nextDouble();
String name         = sc.nextLine();
...
```

3、Once you are done with Scanner, always close it, otherwise you're going to get a resource leak.

```java
sc.close();
```
