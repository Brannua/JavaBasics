## Define functions and call them

See video on udemy.

### Notice

Functions' name needs to represent the task it's performing.

### Notice

`public` means the function can be publicly accessed from any package or subfolder,

but because we've got only one package with a single class in it,

it doesn't really matter what level of access you specify.

### Notice

You can notice that `main()` is also a function,

it has a very similar signature to our functions.

Every function has a specific task that it performs,

and the `main()` function performs the task of running our application.

The `main()` function has a very specific signature that the JVM looks for when you run your app,

and when it finds your `main()` function, it executes it.

> You can reuse the function as many times as you need to.
