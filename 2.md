# Variables

> Store values inside variables.

eg: `int people = 20;`

- The type of value

- The variable name

- The variable value

## Java is strongly typed

which means that variables can only store values of their type.

## The convention to naming variables

use => **lowerCamelCase**

eg: `int peopleOnBus = 20;`

## Java is case sensitive

eg: `people` is not the same as `People`

## Update the value inside a variable

Just set it equal to a new value.

Or use `+=`、`-=`、... for short.
