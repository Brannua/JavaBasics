# Variable

> Store value inside variable.

## Java is strongly typed

which means that variables can only store values of their type.

## Java is case sensitive

eg: `people` is not the same as `People`

## The convention to naming a variable

use => **lowerCamelCase**

eg: `int peopleOnBus = 20;`

---

You will define

```java
// int variables that can store whole numbers
int number = 6;

// long variables that can store large whole numbers
long population = 7800000000L;

// double variables that can store decimals
double decimal = 5.5;

// String variables that can equal text
String text = "Hello";

// char variables that can store single characters
char letter = 'a';
```

## Update the value inside a variable

Just set it equal to a new value,

or use `+=`、`-=`、... for short.
