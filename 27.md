## Preparing to loop arrays

The `length` of an array indicates the number of items it contains.

```java
String[] items = { "apple", "banana", "cherry" };
System.out.println(items.length); // 3
```

So we can use the `length` property to loop arrays.

## Looping arrays

> Arrays and loops are like siblings.

```java
String[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

// If you want to access each element in the array
// Would you perfer to index them all individually ?
numbers[0]
numbers[1]
numbers[2]
numbers[3]
numbers[4]
numbers[5]
// or use some kind of loop that iterates through every single element in the array ?
// I think the looping approach would be more efficient.
```

```java
// Print the elements of an integer array using a loop
int[] numbers = {22, 24, 26, 29, 30};
```

#### for 循环

```java
// autoComplete a for loop in vscode: fori<ENTER>
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

#### foreach 循环

foreach simplifies looping through an array without the need for a counter or a counter increment or anything.

```java
// autoComplete a foreach loop in vscode: fore<ENTER>
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

It just automatically iterates through every single number inside of the numbers array.

So as you can see, foreach is much cleaner and concise than the traditional for loop,

but the traditional for loop is more flexible because the counter `i` give us more control over the looping process.
