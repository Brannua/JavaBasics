## Math operators

So far you've learned about: `int`、`long`、`double`、`String` and `char`.

Now, you can use math operators shown as below to play with these values.

`+, -, *, /, %, ++, --, +=, -=, ...`

### Pattern

An operation between whole numbers returns a whole number.

An operation between decimals will always perserve the decimal.

### Think about that why do we care about the remainder ?

It's very useful if you want to identify odd or even numbers.

```java
int remainder = 10 % 2; // 0
```
