## Math operators

So far you've learned about: `int`、`long`、`double`、`char`、`String`.

You can use math operators to play with these values and operate on them.

## Pattern

- An operation between whole numbers returns a whole number.

- An operation between decimals will always perserve the decimal.

> Notice that we can use the `+` symbol to blend values into a string.

## Think that why do we care about the remainder ?

```java
int remainder = 10 % 2; // 0
```

It's very useful if you want to identify odd or even numbers.
