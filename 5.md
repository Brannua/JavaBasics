### Types: int and long

We can use `int` and `long` variables to store whole numbers.

You should know the difference between `int` and `long` and when to use `int` vs `long`.

```java
int numberOfFans = 5000;
long population = 7800000000L;
```

### Type: double

We can use `double` variables to store decimal numbers.

And it's imperative that you always use `double` for math calculations if precision is important.

Avoid `int` and `long` for math calculations !

```java
double percentage = 55.7;

double dividend = 25;
System.out.println(dividend); // 25.0
```
