### Type: char

We can use the `char` type to store single characters.

```java
char gender = 'F';
```

We can join a String value with a char value using the `+` operator.

```java
System.out.println("Gender: " + 'F');
```

---

```java
String gender = "F";
```

It seems that String is more flexible than char,

so why not always use String ?

The answer is【memory】and【performance】!

char consumes less memory, and char is faster than String !

### Summarize

There are 6 core data types (we didn't cover `boolean` yet).

| Data Type | Value                    | Amount of Memory (Bytes)         | Valid Range of Values                              |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| int       | Whole numbers            | 4                                | From: -2147483648 To: 2147483647                   |
| long      | Very large whole numbers | 8                                | From: -9223372036854775808 To: 9223372036854775807 |
| double    | Decimals                 | 8                                | Decimal can reach 15 significant digits            |
| String    | Text                     | Varies, 24 bytes for empty text. | -                                                  |
| char      | A single character       | 2                                | -                                                  |

平时开发我基本不使用 `byte, short, float`

### 补充知识

在以二进制存储数据的计算机中，浮点数存在误差 ！=> https://liupj.top/2021/08/31/01/
