### Typs: char

We can use the `char` type to store single characters.

```java
char gender = 'F';
```

We can join a String value with a char value using the `+` operator.

```java
System.out.println("Gender: " + 'F');
```

---

```java
String gender = "F";
```

It seems that String is more flexible than char.

So why not always use String ?

The answer is【memory】and【performance】!

char consumes less memory, and char is faster than String !
