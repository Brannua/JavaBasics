## Module 1: Java Fundamentals

Variables: store information

Conditionals: control how your code runs

Loops: control how many times a piece of code needs to run

Arrays: store and work with many values

Functions: perform tasks

Use **objects** to write high-quality code

Apply **exception handling** to produce reliable code

Write **unit test** to avoid bugs and publish your code

Add **inheritance and polymorphism** to promote code reusability

**Concurrency and Multithreading**: optimize performance
