## if - else

Goal: Use if - else to run specific code blocks based on various conditions.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code runs if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code runs if the condition is false
}
```

The condition is usually the result of a comparison that returns true or false.

Not only can we test only one condition, but also many conditions by embedding a series of `else if (condition)` statements.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code
} else if (condition) {
    // Code
} else if (condition) {
    // Code
} else {
    // Code
}
```
